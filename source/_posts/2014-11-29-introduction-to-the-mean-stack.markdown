During today's SpriteXchange session, [Prabu](https://twitter.com/prabh_u06) talked about the MEAN full stack framework which consists of MongoDB as database, Node.js and Express as the server backend and AngularJS as the front end framework.

He talked about basics of MongoDB, Express, Angular & Node.js with a demo application using each of these technologies. 

He then talked about the differences between (http://meanjs.org/)[MEAN.JS] & (http://mean.io/)[MEAN.IO] and how Amos Haviv initiated the MEAN.JS project. Prabu also used the Yeoman generator that comes with MEAN.JS to run a demo MEAN.JS app.
