[Visnupriya](https://twitter.com/visnupriya90) presented one of the wonderful API Building framework named as Grape.

She started from the beginning of Grape framework like what is Grape, basic structure of the Grape and what are the advanced features in the framwrok. 

Then she demonstrated how to integrate Grape with Rails application and build API more easily and then represent the data using grape-entity and how to test that API with Rspec and how to generat documentation automatically using grape-swegger etc.
