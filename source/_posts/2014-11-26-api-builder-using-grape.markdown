[Visnupriya](https://twitter.com/visnupriya90) presented about a wonderful API building framework called [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape).

She started with basics of Grape covering things like what is Grape, the basic structure of Grape and the advanced features provided by the framework. 

She demonstrated how to integrate the grape gem with a Rails application and built a simple demo API with it. She demonstrated various capabilities of Grape like "Grape Entities" with examples.

She then showed how to test these APIs by writing Rspec with the [Airborne](https://github.com/brooklynDev/airborne) gem. 

Finally she finished off with a demo of [Grape-Swagger](https://github.com/tim-vandecasteele/grape-swagger), a gem that can help you to generate documentation for your API.

The sample code used in this talk is available [here](https://github.com/visnupriya/grape-sample) and [here](https://github.com/visnupriya/grape-swagger-rails).
