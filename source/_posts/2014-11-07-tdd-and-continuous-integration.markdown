[Vinothini](https://twitter.com/vinothinibj) talked about the value of TDD and illustrated this by doing a full cycle of Fail - Pass cycle.

She talked about Continuous Integration and how it can add value to a project and be useful for a team.

To demonstrate CI, Vinothini setup Jenkins on a Digital Ocean server and configured it with a sample Rails app on GitHub. She then showed how the tests are run once commits are pushed into GitHub and what we can do when builds fail.

She also talked about Selenium and Sauce Labs with a small demo.
